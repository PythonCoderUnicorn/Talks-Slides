add `fig.retina= x` to make plot higher quality

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.retina=3}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds) +
  aes(cut, fill = cut) +
  geom_bar(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(
    x = "Cut",
    y = "Count",
    title = "A Fancy diamonds Plot"
  ) +
  theme_xaringan(background_color = "#FFFFFF") +
  scale_xaringan_fill_discrete()
```

## R Markdown

change the `output: html_document` to `xaringan::moon_reader`




This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


---


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
